===========

v0.2.0
------

This is not full backward compatible release, as the format of storing
examples changed from YAML to JSON: the default location is at
`doc/apipie_examples.json`. The migration should be as easy as
running:

```
rake apipie:convert_examples
```

Also please not Rails 3.0 support was deprecated and the compatibility
wont be tracked anymore in next releases.
